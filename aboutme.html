<h1>About me.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</h1>
  <p><strong>My name is Manuel Reyes, and I’m a junior at El Camino High School. This year, I’m taking a web design class where I’m learning how to code websites using HTML and CSS. I’m enjoying learning new skills and figuring out how to make my websites look good and work well.&nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p><strong>I decided to take this class because I want to get better at web design and learn what it takes to build a website from start to finish. It’s not just about making things look nice—it’s also about making websites easy to use and interesting for visitors. Every project in class teaches me something new, like how to organize pages or add pictures and links. I want to keep practicing so I can get really good at designing websites.&nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p><strong>In the future, I hope to be a top web designer. Over the next year, I plan to keep learning and building my skills so I can create websites that people will remember. My goal is to mix creativity with coding to make websites that look awesome and work perfectly on any device. I’m excited to keep improving and maybe one day design websites for big companies or my own projects.</strong></p>
