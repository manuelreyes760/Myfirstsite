<h1><em>About me.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</em></h1>
  <p data-start="0" data-end="350"> <img src="../Myfirstwebsitep4/camera.jpg" width="200" style="float:left;margin-right:19px; border:10px solid #716666" alt="">My name is Manuel Reyes, and I am currently a senior at El Camino High School. As I approach the final year of my high school experience, I am filled with both excitement and anticipation for the opportunities that lie ahead. This year, I decided to enroll in a web design class because I have always been deeply fascinated by the creative and technical processes involved in building websites and the crucial role they play in shaping our digital world. Websites are much more than just collections of pages on the internet; they serve as powerful tools that influence how people communicate, share ideas, conduct business, and connect globally. In today’s rapidly evolving technological landscape, digital literacy is essential across nearly every industry, and I believe that learning web design will equip me with valuable skills that extend far beyond simply creating visually appealing sites. By studying web design, I hope to gain a comprehensive understanding of both the artistic elements—such as layout, color theory, and user experience—and the technical foundations, including coding languages like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, which are vital for building responsive, accessible, and efficient websites. I am also eager to explore how websites can be optimized for different devices and audiences, ensuring that they provide seamless and engaging experiences regardless of how users access them. Ultimately, my goal is to develop a versatile and marketable skill set that not only enhances my creativity and problem-solving abilities but also prepares me for a future where technology continues to be an integral part of daily life and work. Whether I choose to pursue a career in computer science, digital marketing, graphic design, or entrepreneurship, I know that the knowledge and experience I gain from this class will serve as a strong foundation for success. This journey excites me because it represents both a personal challenge and a meaningful step toward understanding how I can contribute to the digital world in a way that is innovative, impactful, and relevant. As I navigate this final year of high school, I look forward to growing not only academically but also personally, as I embrace the opportunities to learn new skills, think critically, and prepare myself for the increasingly interconnected and digital future that awaits.&nbsp;</p>
  <img src="boxing.jpg" width="200" style="float:right;margin-right:15px; border:10px solid #686767ff;" alt=""/><p data-start="0" data-end="350">One of the main reasons I decided to take this class is to gain practical, hands-on experience in designing and developing websites from the ground up. I want to deepen my understanding of coding languages like HTML and CSS, explore design principles such as layout, color theory, typography, and responsive design, and learn how to create user-friendly interfaces that provide a smooth and engaging experience for visitors across different devices. This course offers me the chance to apply these skills in real-world contexts, such as helping friends start their own blogs, assisting local businesses in creating an online presence, or even supporting community organizations by designing websites that communicate their message effectively. Additionally, I am interested in understanding how to integrate multimedia elements like images, videos, and interactive features that enhance the overall user experience. Beyond the technical knowledge, I am eager to learn how to manage projects efficiently, collaborate with clients or teammates to understand their vision and feedback, and troubleshoot challenges that inevitably arise during the design process—skills that are essential in any professional environment. By mastering these aspects, I hope to become not only a skilled coder but also a thoughtful designer who can create websites that are both beautiful and functional.</p>

I want to develop a portfolio of projects that showcases my creativity, technical expertise, and problem-solving skills, which will be a valuable asset as I pursue college admissions, internships, or entry-level positions in the technology or digital media industries. I understand that web design is an ever-evolving field, and I am committed to continuous learning and adapting to new tools and trends even after this class ends. This journey is both a challenge and an exciting opportunity, and I am motivated to master the art and science of web design so that I can contribute meaningfully to the digital world—whether by helping others achieve their goals or building a career doing something I love.&nbsp;</p>
